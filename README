Sphere tracing, rendered in ASCII (well, VT100/ANSI terminal emulation really)

This is basically the ASCII equivalent of the GLSL raymarching sandbox:
http://glsl.heroku.com/e#1996.0

There are a couple demos in here, one which has a bunch of random objects on
top of a checkerboard with the light positioned at the camera, and another one
which renders the Square logo (since it was easy to represent with constructive
solid geometry, and some of my friends work at Square).

It's pretty slow and unoptimized.  I plan on using this technique on a more
elaborate obfuscated C demo someday but until then, this is a sandbox for
experiments.

There is also my own webgl/glsl sphere tracing sandbox in webgl.html.
